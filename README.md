# ccast

To create a working development environment, Node Package Manager (NPM) and Yarn are required.
    Yarn can be installed after NPM with the command *npm install --global yarn*

Two terminals are required to run a development version of this project. In both, go to the *CCAST/ccast-gui* directory. Then run the following commands:

    *npm run setup*        - This will take a while.
    *yarn start-api*
    *yarn start*        - This will require the second terminal.
